# iOS Dark Mode

This iOS Dark Mode Project contains two view controllers - A main view controller to display the current apperance, and another modal view controller for settings.

## What this app can do?
1. Provides three type of settings in UITableView - Manual Light mode that makes the whole app in light appearance, Manual Dark mode that makes the whole app in dark appearance, and system-wide mode to follow the devices appearance.
2. Store user settings via UserDefaults, so that the chosen appearance will be stored even though the app is "killed"
3. Show text "Light", "Dark" or "System" based on the chosen appearance.

## Language and framework
It's purely Swift (sorry but Objective-C is not my favorite, OOF), and using Storyboard (UIKit). I will create another project for purely SwiftUI in the future.

## Startup
Just clone the whole repository into your local file. It's recommended to use Xcode 12 and above. The minimum deployment version is iOS 14.0.
